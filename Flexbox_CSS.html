    <h1>Flexbox</h1>
    <pre>
    The flexbox or flexible box model in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces
    among items to control their alignment structure ie it is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange item within a container
    flexbox can be useful for ceating small scale layouts & is responsive and mobile friendly 

    features of flexbox
    @A lot of flexibilty is given
    @arrangment & alignment of items
    @Order & sequencing of items
    @Bootstrap 4 is built on top of the flex layout

    before the flexbox model we had 4 layout modes
    @block: it is used to make sections in web pages
    @Inline : it is used for text 
    @table : it is used for dimensional table data
    @positioned : it is used for the explicit position of an element 

    There are 2 main componenets of the flexbox
    <b>Flex container</b>: The parent div which contains various devisions is called a flex container
    <b>flex items</b>: The items inside the container "div" are flex items
    
    </pre>
    <h1>Flexbox</h1>

    <style>
        .flex_container
        {
            display: flex;
            background-color: green;
        }
        .flex_container div
        {
            background-color: yellow;
            margin: 10px;
            padding: 10px;
        }
    </style>

    <div class="flex_container">
        <div>item1</div>
        <div>item2</div>
        <div>item3</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Flexbox Axes</h2>

    <pre>

    while working with flexbox we deal with 2 Axes
    @main Axis
    @Cross Axis
     
    <b>main Axis</b>
    By Default the main axis runs from left tp right 
    @Main Start: The start of the main axis is called Main start
    @Main size : The length between main start and main end is called main size
    @main end : The endpoint is called main end 
    main and cross axis

    left to right 
    @flex-direction:row;

    right to left
    @flex-direction:row reverse

    top to bottom
    flex-direction:column 

    bottom to top
    flex-direction:column-reverse 

    Cross Axis:The Cross axis will be perpendicular to the main axis

    <b>Cross Axis</b>: the cross Axis will be perpendicular to the main axis
    by Default cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis i.e from top to bottom

    cross start: start of the cross axis is called cross start
    cross size: th length between cross start and cross end is called cross size
    cross end: the endpoint is called cross end

        <b>pre flexbox</b>A recap of some properties in CSS which might be realated to learning flexbox
        @we have different positional properties such as absolute and relative depeding on how we want to place our element in our page
        @floats,grids,clear fixes to help aid in the postioning
        @fixed heights for columns(one of the main elements to create flexbox)

        @flexbox is a CSS display type design to help us to craft CSS layout quite easily 
        @control the position,Size and spacing of elements realative to their parents elements and each other
        @they are great for responsive designing 
        @It has its own set of properties.
        @It defines formatting context,which controls layout
        @It is parent-child relationship
        
      <b>Basic of flexbox</b>
      Apply a display type of flexbox to the parent container this would make all the child elements in it to adjsut into the flex type and these
      would be called the flex item this means they have become more flexible we can control how much they can shrink and how much they can grow
      and also the spacing between these elements

      @flex container can change the width,height and order of the child elements
      @items can grow or shrink to fill the avilable space or to prevent overflow
      @available space is distributed among the other items

        <pre>
        <b>Prent properties </b>
         @display: define a flex container - flex formatting context
         @flex-direction: defines the main axis insides the container 
         @flex-wrap: allow flex items to wrap onto more than one line 
         @flex-flow:shorthand for flex-direction +flex-wrap 
         @justify-content: allow items to align along main axis
         @align-content: allow items to align along cross axis in a single line
         @align-items:align multiple lines of items on the cross axis

         <b>Children/flex-items properties</b>
         @Order: allows the change of order of items without altering the source order
         @flex-grow : allows an item to fill up the abvailable free space 
         @flex-shrink : allows an item to shrink it there is no enough free space available 
         @flex-basis: defines the size of an item before space is distributed
         @flex:it the shorthand for flex-grow +flex-shrink +flex-basis
         @flex-self: has the ability to align one single item within the flex container
